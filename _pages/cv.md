## Research Overview
I am an undergraduate researcher at **Kyung Hee University** interested in **planning and decision-making for long-horizon problems**, with a particular focus on **offline-to-online reinforcement learning**, **world models**, and **diffusion/transformer-based policies**.

I am particularly interested in how **representation learning and sampling strategies** affect exploration, stability, and robustness under **distribution shift**.  
My background includes building **end-to-end learning systems**—from data collection and representation learning to evaluation and failure-mode analysis—which motivates my current focus on **scalable and reliable learning frameworks for complex environments**.
